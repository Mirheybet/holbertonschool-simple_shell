## Custom Commands

Basic Shell supports the following custom commands:

- `exit`: The command causes the shell or program to terminate. If performed within an interactive command shell, the user is logged out of their current session, and/or user's current console or terminal connection is disconnected. Typically an optional exit code can be specified, which is typically a simple integer value that is then returned to the parent process.
- `env`: The env command allows you to display your current environment or run a specified command in a changed environment.
